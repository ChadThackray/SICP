# SICP

My solutions from my reading of Structure and interpretation of computer programs.
 * [original book](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) 
 * [with nice formatting](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml#Top)

Would recommend using [dr racket](https://racket-lang.org/) with the [sicp package](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/sicp). Which has functions that are in the book but have been written out of scheme over time. Install the SICP package with 
```
raco pkg install sicp
```
Recommend installing dr racket to your home dir or somewhere sudo permissions not required.

Then if you use VSCode the `Magic Racket` plugin.
